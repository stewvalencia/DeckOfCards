DeckOfCards
===========

A simple DeckOfCards program with a Card class and Deck class.

Card objects have a suit (H-D) and a value (A-K). The class is also immutable.

Decks are an array of Cards with a shuffle and dealOneCard method.
Shuffle mixed the card array with each permutations are equal likely to be selected as the shuffle.
dealOneCard deals a card from the deck. If the deck is empty, dealOneCard throws an exception.

I also included a test class that do simple tests on the Deck class methods.
